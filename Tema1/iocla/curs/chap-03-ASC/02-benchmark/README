Build all the demos 
# make 

Demo 01:

1. Run hello world demo  
# hello 

2. SASM session to see the IDE
# sasm hello.asm 
- set a breakpoint @ main 
- start debugging with F5
- run step by step  to see registers changing

3. Quick gdb walkthrough (b - breakpoint, n - next instruction, p - print, r - run, s - start = [b main, r], q - quit)
# gdb hello 
b main 
p (char*)(&msg) 
p len
r 
n 
n
q

Demo 02:
1. Example to show one way to use assembler inside C code (inline asm)
# less inline.c 


Demo 03:
Examples from chapter 1 in the textbook 
C code is compiled to binary c.out 
ASM code is compiled to binary asm.out 

Compare running time for 1000 iterations 
# time { echo 1000 | ./asm.out ; } 
# time { echo 1000 | ./c.out ; } 


Clean up directory 
# make clean 

Quick review of Makefile and compile options 
# less Makefile
